# Content Creators
Submitted by: Jennifer Guadarrama 

About my web app: 
I included creators from entertainment, beauty, and music content. I have been watching Ryukhar and MrBeast's content for years now and its amazing to see them grow on their journey as they continue their content. Slayfirecosmetics is an ecommerce that sells biodegradable glitter. I've purchased some of her products before and they surpass any glitter i've purchased. Malvina Isfan is a makeup artist who creates fashion makeup looks. They go from simple glitter looks to graphic and bold looks. She inspires me to do more makeup using her style. Thefatrat is my favorite music composer, his music has always given me hope and strength. It makes me happy to see people use his music in the gaming industry, especially in geometry dash. Codebeauty was a huge help in terms of object oriented programming in c++. She explains and shows how it works in a way that helped me understand it better. 

Time spent: more than 10hrs

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add:

One of the challenges I faced was exporting a single creator at a time and trying to have their own page. This step wasn't clear so I tried other alternatives such as adding an id section, where I can have the pages begin with a slash "/", so it is easier to link them later on. I made sure to include them in the router and successfully have each creator with their own page.

Another challenge I faced was using supabase as this was very new to me. So I took the time to read the documentation and see how it works.
